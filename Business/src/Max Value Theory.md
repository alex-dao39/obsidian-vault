## Building a business is just solving this equation

$$\text{value of a business} = \text{max(value provided to other)}$$
## Value of what your business offers customers

The value of a business can be defined as follow:

$$Value_{offer}={\frac{\text{Dream outcome x Percieved Likelihood of Achievment}}{\text{Time Delay * Efforts \& Sacrifice}}}$$
where
$$Value_{offer} > Price$$
### Value of business as a whole

Value of a SaaS business (< $1M ARR)

$$Value_{SaaS}=(MRR-\text{monthly cost})*12*4$$
Value of a e-commerce business
$$Value_{e-commerce}=\text{annual profit}*3$$
Value of an agency business
$$Value_{Agency}=\text{annual profit}*3$$
Value of a marketplace, social app, personal networks
$$Value_{network}=\text{MetcalfesÂ Law}=\text{(number of nodes in network)}^2$$
